The Blunder

Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's 0 key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeroes removed), and the actual average salary.

Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.: actual-miscalcuated average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.

Input Format
The EMPLOYEES table is described as follows:
+---------+---------+
|Column   |Type     |
+---------+---------+
|ID       |Integer  |
+---------+---------+
|Name     |String   |
+---------+---------+
|Salary   |Integer  |
+---------+---------+
Salary is measured in dollars per month and its value is <10^5.

E.g. Actual Salary=2006 Misinput Salary=26

select ceil(avg(Salary)-avg(replace(Salary,'0',''))) from EMPLOYEES;
