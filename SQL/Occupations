Occupations

Pivot the Occupation column in OCCUPATIONS so that each Name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding Occupation. The output column headers should be Doctor, Professor, Singer, and Actor, respectively.
Note: Print NULL when there are no more names corresponding to an occupation.

Explanation
The first column is an alphabetically ordered list of Doctor names.
The second column is an alphabetically ordered list of Professor names.
The third column is an alphabetically ordered list of Singer names.
The fourth column is an alphabetically ordered list of Actor names.
The empty cell data for columns with less than the maximum number of names per occupation (in this case, the Professor and Actor columns) are filled with NULL values.

-- 这居然不是困难题？？？

set @r1=0, @r2=0, @r3=0, @r4=0; -- set @变量名=值，创建自定义用户变量，当前的用断开连接的时候就会消失
select min(Doctor), min(Professor), min(Singer), min(Actor) 
-- min/max是为了满足maximum number of names per occupation，不使用min/max的结果会是一个18行4列的输出
-- There is no difference between min OR max, because you have only one name for one occupation for each rownumber min(name) = max(name).
from(
  select case when Occupation='Doctor' then (@r1:=@r1+1)
            when Occupation='Professor' then (@r2:=@r2+1)
            when Occupation='Singer' then (@r3:=@r3+1)
            when Occupation='Actor' then (@r4:=@r4+1) end as RowNumber,-- @r1:=@r1+1相当于给Occupation排名（rank）
    case when Occupation='Doctor' then Name end as Doctor,
    case when Occupation='Professor' then Name end as Professor,
    case when Occupation='Singer' then Name end as Singer,
    case when Occupation='Actor' then Name end as Actor -- 重组了一张新表，四列分别是四个职业，行数由@r决定

  order by Name

group by RowNumber -- 使用了group by可以保证在没有值的时候返回null；不使用只会返回第一行
