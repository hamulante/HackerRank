Weather Observation Station 20

A median（中位数) is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to 4 decimal places.

set @N := 0;
select count(*) from STATION into @TOTAL; -- @TOTAL=总行数
select
    round(A.LAT_N, 4)
from (select @N := @N +1 AS ROW_ID, LAT_N from STATION order by LAT_N) as A
where
    case when mod(@TOTAL, 2) = 0 
            then A.ROW_ID in (@TOTAL/2, (@TOTAL/2+1))
            else A.ROW_ID = (@TOTAL+1)/2
    end
;
