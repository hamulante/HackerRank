Top Earners

We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly salary*months worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as 2 space-separated integers.

select salary*months, count(*) from Employee 
group by 1 -- 1 represents max(salary*months)
order by 1 desc -- 1 represents max(salary*months)
limit 1;-- 不写这个，会把所有的工资+人数从高到低排列一遍
